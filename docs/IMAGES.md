   - Good natural lighting (morning or afternoon)
   - Wide-angle lens (16-35mm) for rooms
   - Clean and stage the space
   - Vertical shots for some variety

2. **Consistency:** Keep color tone and style consistent across all photos

   - Natural stone textures
   - Cedar elements
   - Coffee bar setup
   - Rainfall shower
   - Pet-friendly backyard

4. **Professional Option:** Consider hiring a local real estate photographer:
   - Cost: $150-300 per property
   - Worth it for quality photos
   - Can use on Airbnb too

**Note:** While these stock images work well as placeholders or if you need quick professional photos, your actual property photos will always be the best choice for authenticity and showing guests exactly what they're booking.
